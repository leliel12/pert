"""The program (or project) evaluation and review technique (PERT).

Pert is a statistical tool used in project management, which was designed to
analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project.

First developed by the United States Navy in the 1958, it is commonly used in
conjunction with the critical path method in the year 1957 (CPM).
